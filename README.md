Stacks are a type of linear data structure that follow the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end of the stack, which is called the top of the stack.

Queues are also a type of linear data structure, but they follow the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. Elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front of the queue.
